### NOTE 2-13-2021

I developed School Management System for our final project at ALX School. This master branch features what I deployed for presentation at ALX. What it doesn't feature is a revamp I worked on independently afterwards, in an effort to practice ReactJs/Next.js, Express and Redux. You can view this revamped work at [this branch](https://github.com/pyshola/alx-school_management_project).


## Description :bulb:

School Management Software is school record automation and student information system. From record-keeping of finances, assessments to compiling of results, the digital platform gives users the ability to monitor administrative tasks on a single platform

### Why statically-typed?

Our kind of question.

The front-end of IdeaDog is built in Bootstrap, while the back-end runs on Nodejs.
